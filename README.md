# My Home Assistant configuration

Feel free to use whatever you find here for your own Home Assistant or other home automation.

## Use Cases

Includes automations for the following use cases:

* :zap: smart lights:
  * :snake: changing color temperature automatically based on time of day and of year
  * :thread: :camel: multi-stage wake-up light sequence, interruptable
  * :camel: Turning lights off while away from home
  * :calendar: :camel: Putting lights in vacation mode, prompted when an appropriate calendar event is detected
* other:
  * :zap: :camel: Reminders for when the washing machine is finished can be scheduled through a button next to the washing machine
  * :snake: The admin user is prompted when there are available updates

## Components

I use the following components to implement this

### Devices

* 1 **Raspberry Pi 4B 4GB** with a 32GB high-quality microSD with Home Assistant OS
* :zap: Phoscon **ConBee 2** Zigbee USB gateway
* :zap: Zigbee devices:
  * 9 IKEA Tr책dfri lights (not RGB, but white to yellow)
  * 6 IKEA Tr책dfri remotes with 5 buttons each
  * 1 IKEA Tr책dfri wireless control outlet
  * 1 IKEA Tr책dFri on/off remote

### Integrations

* :zap: **deconz** for Zigbee connection to smart lights, switch and buttons
* **Telegram bot** for 2-way communication, not limited to the local network
* The Home Assistant **app** for other notifications
* :calendar: Google for the **Calendar**

### Add-ons for automation logic


* Standard HA YAML (rhymes with :camel:) still has many of my automations, but I intend to move the bigger ones to one of the other platforms:
* :thread: **Node-Red** for flow-based automation
  * Contains all functions of all :zap: buttons
* :snake: **AppDaemon** for more programmatic automation using Python
  * Contains complex time logic
  * and the programmatic update notification logic

### Add-ons, other

* :zap: The **deconz** instance for the Zigbee network
* Some utility add-ons:
  * **VS Code** in front-end in browser
  * **Samba share** for easy access to the machine file from Windows pc
